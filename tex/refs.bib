abstract = {This paper proves the confluency and the strong normalizability of the call-by-value $λμ$-calculus with the domain-free style. The confluency of the system is proved by improving the parallel reduction method of Baba et al. The strong normalizability is proved by using the modified CPS-translation, which preserves the typability and the reduction relation. This paper defines the class of the reductions whose strictness is preserved by the modified CPS-translation to prove the strong normalizability.},

abstract = {Many fields of study in compilers give rise to the concept of a join point—a place where different execution paths come together. Join points are often treated as functions or continuations, but we believe it is time to study them in their own right. We show that adding join points to a direct-style functional intermediate language is a simple but powerful change that allows new optimizations to be performed, including a significant improvement to list fusion. Finally, we report on recent work on adding join points to the intermediate language of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.},
