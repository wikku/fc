abstract = {This paper proves the confluency and the strong normalizability of the call-by-value $λμ$-calculus with the domain-free style. The confluency of the system is proved by improving the parallel reduction method of Baba et al. The strong normalizability is proved by using the modified CPS-translation, which preserves the typability and the reduction relation. This paper defines the class of the reductions whose strictness is preserved by the modified CPS-translation to prove the strong normalizability.},
