abstract = {This paper proves the confluency and the strong normalizability of the call-by-value $λμ$-calculus with the domain-free style. The confluency of the system is proved by improving the parallel reduction method of Baba et al. The strong normalizability is proved by using the modified CPS-translation, which preserves the typability and the reduction relation. This paper defines the class of the reductions whose strictness is preserved by the modified CPS-translation to prove the strong normalizability.},

We show that adding join points to a direct-style functional intermediate language is a simple but powerful change that allows new optimizations to be performed, including a significant improvement to list fusion. Finally, we report on recent work on adding join points to the intermediate language of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.},
